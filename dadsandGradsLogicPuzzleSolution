A joint Father’s Day and graduation party is being thrown for Michael, Ken, James, Alberto, Elias, and Stephanie. Three of them are newly minted high school graduates. The other three are their dads.

Stephanie went to the senior prom with Michael’s son.

Elias and James played on the school’s baseball team. One of them is Alberto’s son.

Michael and Elias are not related.

Since we know that Michael and Alberto are fathers since it was said that Stephanie went to prom with Michael’s son, and either Elias and James are Alberto’s son. With this information, we can distinguish and separate them as fathers - from the graduates.

We know that Stephanie, Elias and James are the graduates  based on the passage stating that Stephanie went to prom and Elias and James played on the baseball team. This would make Ken the third father.

athers - Michael, Ken and Alberto
Graduates - Stephanie, Elias and James

Since either James and Elias are Alberto’s son, that would leave Michael and Ken (fathers) left. Stephanie going to prom with Michael’s son would cancel out the option for Stephanie to be Michael’s daughter, deeming her as Ken’s daughter. 

Since we know Michael and Elias are not related, we can deem by process of elimination and prior knowledge that James is his son.

Elias can be assumed by process of elimination to be the son to Alberto based on the above logic.
