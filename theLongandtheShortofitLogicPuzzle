The Long and the Short of It logic puzzle:

Here’s a great logic puzzle for kids: Six neighborhood children (Leisha, Benito, Delia, Charlotte, Weldon, and Zina) were measured yesterday.

Weldon is taller than Delia but shorter than Zina.

Leisha is taller than Benito but shorter than Delia and Weldon.

Benito is not the shortest.

It was noted above that Weldon was taller than Delia and shorter than Zina. It did not state elsewhere that Zina was shorter than anyone else, which allowed me to conclude that Zina is the tallest. 

With Zina being the tallest and the passage stating that Weldon was taller than Delia without stating that he was shorter than anyone else, I concluded that Weldon was the second tallest. 

I concluded that Delia came right after Weldon as the third tallest because the passage states that the next child, Leisha was shorter than Delia, but taller than Benito.

Following this, with the passage stating that Benito wasn’t the shortest, but Leisha was taller than Benito, I concluded that Leisha was the next tallest and then Benito. 

According to the above logic and process of elimination, the last available child and presumably the shortest would then be Charlotte.
