Presidents Day:

George, William, John, Abe, and Millard have their birthdays on consecutive days, all between Monday and Friday.

Millard’s birthday is on Thursday.

George’s birthday is as many days before Millard’s and William’s is after Abe’s.

We know that Millard’s birthday is on Thursday. There are four days before Millard’s birthday, and if we count back four consecutive days (between Monday-Friday), we land on Friday, making George’s birthday on Friday.

John is two days older than Abe.

With Thursday and Friday spoken for, we only have Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday available for the others. 

Knowing this, and knowing John is two days older than Abe, this would make John’s birthday fall on Monday, and Abe’s on Wednesday. 
Based on the process of elimination, the last day available - Tuesday, would be for William’s birthday.
